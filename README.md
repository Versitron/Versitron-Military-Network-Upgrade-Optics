## What is Bidirectional SFP

**An overview of BiDi SFP modules for efficient fiber use.**

- Transmits and receives data over a single fiber strand using WDM (Wavelength Division Multiplexing)  
- Reduces cabling costs while maintaining full-duplex communication  
- Available for 100Mbps, 1Gbps, and 10Gbps networks  
- Compact design supports high-density network deployments  

Perfect for single-fiber networks, point-to-point links, and cost-sensitive deployments.

## How BiDi SFP Works

**Understanding the operation of bidirectional fiber modules.**

- Uses two wavelengths: one for transmitting and one for receiving on the same fiber  
- Eliminates the need for separate fibers for each direction  
- Compatible with standard SFP ports on switches and media converters  
- Maintains full-speed, low-latency, and interference-free data transfer  

Ideal for network engineers and IT teams optimizing fiber infrastructure for minimal cabling.
